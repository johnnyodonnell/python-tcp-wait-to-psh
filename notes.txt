* Other ideas
    - I could try sending the TCP segments in reverse. The idea
        would be that the application can't continue until it
        receives the first segment.

* My first strategy was to try sending the entire payload in a single
        datagram, but this did not work. This repo uses a strategy
        that waits to set the PSH flag until the end
