* Sending the entire payload under a single datagram doesn't
        seem like it will be a viable option.
    - At first I was getting an OSError:
        * `OSError: [Errno 90] Message too long`
        * However, I was able to fix this by increasing the MTU
                with the following command
            - `sudo ifconfig tun0 mtu 5000 up`
            - This fixed the OSError, but I still couldn't get
                the packet through
    - Once I solved the OSError issue, I still couldn't get the
        packet through. I'm assuming the VPN drops packets that
        are too large.
    - I need to try sending multiple datagrams but without
        checking the PSH flag until the end.
